# heading for ZMQ_REP

# Since CtrlC generally doesn't work, I recommend forking
# these from your shell (ie start zmqReq.py <port> on Windows
# or zmqRep.py <port>

# requests, recv is called first, then
# a send, and so-on
#
# To quote the man page:
# > Each request received is fair-queued from among all clients,
# > and each reply sent is routed to the client that issued the 
# > last request. If the original requester doesn't exist any 
# > more the reply is silently discarded.
